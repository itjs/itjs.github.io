      <h1>Structure</h1>
      <p class="bodytext"><strong>Bone is not uniformly solid,</strong> but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%) which are intricately woven and endlessly
      remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight.
      Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as <i class="scientific">ossein</i>, and the remainder is ground substance. The elasticity of
      collagen improves fracture resistance. The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt calcium phosphate in a chemical arrangement
      known as <i class="scientific">calcium hydroxylapatite</i>. It is the bone mineralization that give bones rigidity. Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life
      by special bone cells known as <i class="scientific">osteoblasts</i> and <i class="scientific">osteoclasts</i>. Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known as <i class="scientific">cortical</i>
      and <i class="scientific">cancellous bone</i>, and each with different appearance and characteristics.</p>

      <h2>Cortical Bone</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">The hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone also called compact bone being much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones.
        The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human skeleton. It facilitates
        bone's main functions: to support the whole body, protect organs, provide levers for movement, and store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of
        multiple microscopic columns, each called an <i class="scientific">osteon</i>. Each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the <i class="scientific">haversian canal</i>.
        Volkmann's canals at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are <strong>metabolically active</strong>, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the
        cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a <i class="scientific">periosteum</i> on its outer surface, and an <i class="scientific">endosteum</i> on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary
        between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the osteon.</p>
