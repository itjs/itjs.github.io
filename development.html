      <h1>Development</h1>
      <p class="bodytext">The formation of bone is called <i class="science"> ossification </i>. During the fetal stage of development this occurs by two processes: <i class="science"> intramembranous </i>
        ossification </i> and <i class="scientific"> endochondral ossification </i>. Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone from connective tissue whereas endochondral ossification
        involves the formation of bone from cartilage. Intramembranous ossification mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the skull but also the <i class="scientific"> mandible</i>, <i class="scientific">maxilla</i>,
        and <i class="scientific">clavicles</i>; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as <i class="scientific">mesenchyme</i> tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes:
      <ul class="processes">
        <li>the development of the ossification center</li>
        <li>calcification trabeculae formation</li>
        <li>the development of the periosteum</li>

      <h2>Cortical Bone</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">The hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone also called compact bone being much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones.
        The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human skeleton. It facilitates
        bone's main functions: to support the whole body, protect organs, provide levers for movement, and store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of
        multiple microscopic columns, each called an <i class="scientific">osteon</i>. Each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the <i class="scientific">haversian canal</i>.
        Volkmann's canals at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are <strong>metabolically active</strong>, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the
        cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a <i class="scientific">periosteum</i> on its outer surface, and an <i class="scientific">endosteum</i> on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary
        between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the osteon.</p>

      <h2>Cancellous Bone</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">Cancellous bone, also called <i class="scientific">trabecular</i> or spongy bone, is the <strong>internal</strong> tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell porous network.
          Cancellous bone has a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than cortical bone because it is less dense. This makes it weaker and more flexible. The greater surface
          area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near joints
          and in the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly vascular and often contains red bone marrow where <i class="scientific">hematopoiesis</i>, the production of blood cells, occurs.
          The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the <i class="scientific">trabecula</i>. The trabeculae are aligned towards the <strong>mechanical load distribution</strong> that a bone
          experiences within long bones such as the femur. As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the vertebral pedicle. Thin
          formations of osteoblasts covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces, known as trabeculae. Within these spaces are bone marrow and hematopoietic
          stem cells that give rise to <i class="scientific">platelets</i>, red blood cells and white blood cells. Trabecular marrow is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ
          lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow. Trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass <em>but has nearly ten times</em> the surface area
          of compact bone. The words cancellous and trabecular refer to the tiny lattice-shaped units (trabeculae) that form the tissue. It was first illustrated accurately in the
          engravings of <strong>Cris√≥stomo Martinez</strong>.</p>
