      <h1> Some Bone Cold Facts</h1>
      Bone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%) which are intricately woven and endlessly
       remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight.
      Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as ossein,[3] and the remainder is ground substance.[4] The elasticity of
       collagen improves fracture resistance.[5] The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt calcium phosphate in a chemical arrangement
        known as calcium hydroxylapatite. It is the bone mineralization that give bones rigidity. Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by special bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known as cortical and cancellous bone, and each with different appearance and characteristics.
