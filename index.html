      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <strong>Bone is not uniformly solid,</strong> but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%) which are intricately woven and endlessly
      remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight.
      Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as <i class="scientific">ossein</i>, and the remainder is ground substance. The elasticity of
      collagen improves fracture resistance. The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt calcium phosphate in a chemical arrangement
      known as <i class="scientific">calcium hydroxylapatite</i>. It is the bone mineralization that give bones rigidity. Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life
      by special bone cells known as <i class="scientific">osteoblasts<i> and <i class="scientific">osteoclasts</i>. Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known as <i class="scientific">cortical</i>
      and <i class="scientific">cancellous bone</i>, and each with different appearance and characteristics.
